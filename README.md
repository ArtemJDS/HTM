# HTM

My plans
#
1.Working HTM programm.

Here I'm trying to undestand the thing about how HTM work but not on the theory level but make it myself. So "HTM toy" is created.
#
2.Faster and proper HTM programm.

If I get round to re-write it using C++ it will be greate. Otherwise I will try to undestand nuts and bolts of the Numenta realization
#
3.Real data.

Now i don't have a real-world problem and corresponding data but I will find it and apply HTM
#
4.My own ideas.

Currently I have some ideas about i)encoders for HTM and ii) plastisity in network. Hopefully some of them will work out
